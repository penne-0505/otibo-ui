# Validator fixtures

These fixtures exercise the repository validators themselves.

They are not active project tasks or QA records. `scripts/test-validators.mjs`
runs the validators against these files and expects:

- files under `valid/` to pass;
- files under `invalid/` to fail.

The intent and QA fixtures run through their validators with `--fixture` and
use `fixture_path` front matter so the validators can apply the normal
canonical-path rules while the fixture files remain under `_evals/`.

The QA invalid fixture without `qa_schema` also verifies legacy compatibility:
legacy plans still require an `INV-*`, while schema v2 accepts `None`.

Frontmatter fixtures verify that `intent_schema` and `qa_schema` are accepted
without warnings only under their matching document types. The wrong-type
fixture and generic `custom_field` fixture keep unknown-field warnings
observable.
